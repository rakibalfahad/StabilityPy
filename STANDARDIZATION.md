# Code Standardization Summary

This document summarizes the code standardization improvements applied to the StabilityPy codebase.

## Changes Made

### Code Style Fixes
- Fixed PEP 8 style issues:
  - Removed trailing whitespaces
  - Fixed indentation issues (continuation lines)
  - Fixed line length issues
  - Removed blank lines with whitespace

### Project Structure Improvements
- Added `.gitignore` for standardized Git usage
- Added `setup.cfg` with standardized linting configurations
- Added `.pre-commit-config.yaml` for pre-commit hooks
- Updated `setup.py` to include development dependencies
- Added `DEVELOPMENT.md` guide for contributors

### Development Workflow
- Configured code quality tools:
  - Flake8 for linting
  - Black for code formatting
  - isort for import sorting
  - pytest and pytest-cov for testing and coverage

### Documentation
- Added comprehensive development guide
- Standardized docstring format (NumPy style)

## How to Maintain Code Standards

1. Use the development environment:
   ```bash
   pip install -e ".[dev]"
   pre-commit install
   ```

2. Before committing changes, run:
   ```bash
   flake8 stability_selection
   pytest stability_selection/tests
   ```

3. Follow the guidelines in DEVELOPMENT.md

## Remaining Issues

Some issues may still exist in the codebase that should be addressed:

1. Unused imports in randomized_lasso.py
2. Some long lines in bootstrap.py
3. Remaining whitespace issues in bootstrap.py

These can be fixed by running:
```bash
make lint
```

## Future Improvements

1. Add continuous integration (CI) using GitHub Actions or similar
2. Expand test coverage
3. Improve documentation with more examples
4. Consider adding typing hints (mypy)
